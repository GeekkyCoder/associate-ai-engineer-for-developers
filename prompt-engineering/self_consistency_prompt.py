# Self-consistency prompts
# Imagine you own a store that sells laptops and mobile phones. You start your day with 50 devices in the store, out of which 60% are mobile phones. Throughout the day, three clients visited the store, each of them bought one mobile phone, and one of them bought additionally a laptop. Also, you added to your collection 10 laptops and 5 mobile phones. How many laptops and mobile phones do you have by the end of the day? This problem is defined in the problem_to_solve string, and you will use a self-consistency prompt to solve it.
